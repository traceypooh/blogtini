    "body": "<p>Another successful ride!  We had five riders total and mostly kept in a relatively close together group for most of the ride.  It was sunny and warm, and the pace was fast (thanks to the 3 non-leader riders being *very* strong and fast).  So Hunter and I mostly tried to hold on as best we could and make our legs get in some really good training.  No flats!</p>\n",
