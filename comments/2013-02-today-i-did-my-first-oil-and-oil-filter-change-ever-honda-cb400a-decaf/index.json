    "body": "<p>That you took pics of your first oil change is hilarious!  But I&#8217;m really posting this comment to get in touch, because I think I knew you at CU, where I worked for Bruce and Dan.  I had a different name then, and looked different, though!  We took a motorcycle ride together once, but that was before you had a license, I think.  I had a CBR600.  Drop me an email sometime!</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Hi Tracy,   I have the same motorcycle here in NH!   1978 CB400A.   I love the cafe racer style of your bike.   Very nice work.   Mine sat in my friends shop for many years, then he decided to get it going for me.   It has the original seat and mostly original parts.   I love that bike and soooo many people want to talk to me about it.   My husband&#8217;s boring Harley gets no attention, but there is always a fan club around my bike.   I joke with my husband that if I want to meet men, I just need to travel around on that bike!  I hope you are still riding her and that she lasts for many more years.</p>\n",

    "body": "<p>Hi June,<br />\nhehe, awesome to hear!  I grew up in NH, so it&#8217;s a trip to think of you potentially riding down the same roads and scenes as I would have &#8212; but with our shared bike \ud83d\ude0e<br />\nGlad you like the mods &#8212; all were done by the prior owner, except the total consolidation, cleanup, and replacement of all the instruments and area (speedo, neutral and directional indicators and other lights, etc.)  (which is quite easy to do if you ever get the inkling \ud83d\ude09<br />\nMy boyfriend&#8217;s Harley got waaaay less attention too, and he had really styled it and nearly &#8220;murdered&#8221; it, too.  It&#8217;s nice to get the kudos from people who see the bike and it takes them back to their Honda CB from 30+ years ago, isn&#8217;t it?<br />\n(And it&#8217;s very nice to feel like we are stewards of some true Antiques that have quite the heritage and history, too).</p>\n<p>And yes, I&#8217;m sure you can get as much attention as you&#8217;d care for, with the fans that attract to your bike.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot for the comment and thoughts &#8212; always appreciated to connect with another kindred rider &#8212; and another kindred sister!</p>\n",
