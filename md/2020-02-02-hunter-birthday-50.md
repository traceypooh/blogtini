Just did something utterly crazy - chartered a 🧑‍✈️ private plane ✈️ to Palm Springs 🌴 and Joshua Tree (via Jeep Wranglers) for Hunter's 50th Birthday! 💖

(Also worth noting: celebrated on rare palindrome date: `02 02 20 20` -- which in a mirror is `50` backwards 😮 )

This took over a month to research, pull off, and plan!  I've never done a charter plane before so it took quite some time to figure out planes, quotes and more.  I'd like to thank the amazing Captain [Jan Johnson]( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-JsGXULZL8HTUYCL8btaEg) for helping me research and suggesting, ultimately, who we went with - [Centurion FS](https://www.centurionfs.com/) out of Palo Alto.

We rented a _super cute_ "Quest Kodiak 100" plane, able to seat 8 very comfortably, single prop plane.

_Ironically_ the major amount of planning, devoted to going to **Death Valley**, got scuttled 12h before take-off due to high wind advisory - specifically including _Furnace Creek_ landing strip (not much of an airport - mostly tarmac and tower - no refuel options, etc.).  The very accomodating Pilot called me and we spent 40 minutes trying to find any way to make it work -- an then ultimately decided to change to Palm Springs + Joshua Tree (two places I've always wanted to visit).  It took only ~20m more to fly there and back, and +5% extra cost -- with lots of scramblings to procure a pair of genuine Jeep Wranglers.  Thankfully, it _just worked!_

Huge shout out to Hunter's **amazing** friends who all went with the last-minute changes, kept it secret, and were up for this _crazy_ adventure from [6am to 9pm].

After a beautiful ~2h cruise over California at only ~10,000 foot from the ground, we arrived in Palm Springs ~10:30am.

had a really nice brunch and cocktails on Kaiser Grille patio (but under shade ;-) right out on the main strip (and olde town area).

I flew in a _decadent_ chocolate cake and candles which the server set up for us at the end.

Then we took the Jeeps and had ~4-1/2 hours to do a (mostly driving) tour of **Joshua Tree** (~40m drive from downtown).

We jumped out at some of the great and interesting areas, like Cholla Cactus Garden:

We even did just a bit of off-road 4x4 (my favorite ;-)

We had a blast and soaked up the hot dry sun while the Bay Area was getting a very strong cold snap.  We had a bit of an adventure on the return in some high up-to-11,000' clouds -- sorry Amy!  They had some turbulent moments, but the vast majority of the flight was way above the clouds (and bumps and danger).

*_Thank you_* Captain Jim 🧑‍✈️ (pictured in top photo above, left side) for keeping us safe and giving us an _utterly amazing_ weekend.  Hunter was beaming and grinning ear-to-ear, getting to be on radio and in copilot seat both ways the entire time.
