## A little (more about me)

I'm into software, UI/UX, video, devops, biking, time-lapse photography, sewing, design, lighting, and
interior decorating.

I have a twin!

It's true!


## My Work
I'm presently working at
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org).


# About this site
I modeled this after my personal website https://traceypooh.com that uses
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) -- a static site engine written in Go.
(I migrated from wordpress).

- I now write in _Markdown_ - very natural and simple.
- I copied most of the them features from: [Hugo Future Imperfect Slim](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim), porting from `Go` templates to pure `javascript`
- We can use GitHub or GitLab to host the entire website in a single code repository.
  - It _very_ nicely auto builds/deploy upon each `git push`.
  - It's totally free except for any optional domain name (for modest annual fee, typically ~$20 USD/yr)
