## A little (more about me)

I have a twin!  It's true!
<br><a href="/family">Russ and Tracey<a>

I'm into software, UI/UX, video, biking, time-lapse photography, sewing, design, lighting, and
interior decorating.

Tracey moved (after 6 years in San Francisco) to a little mountain
🐮 town -- the Montclair district in the Oakland hills.

# About this site
**[2019]**
Migrated to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) -- a static site engine written in Go.  (I migrated from wordpress).

- I now write in _Markdown_ - very natural and simple.
- Using website theme: [Hugo Future Imperfect Slim](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim)
- I'm using GitLab to host the entire website in a single code repository.  It _very_ nicely auto builds/deploy upon each `git push`.  It's totally free except for the domain name modest annual fee.
- [Some details about the migration](/2019/09/techo-tuesday-make-a-free-website-static-site-generators-and-hugo/).

**[2010]** I've finally taken the plunge to the ubiquitous
<a href="https://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> as the basis of my completely
rewritten (June 2010) website, using a custom plugin and custom new HTM/CSS/JS
"<a href="//poohBot.com/2015/05/06/slide-responsively-minimal-standalone-htmcssjs-inspired-by-sliding-door-from-wayne-connor">slide-responsively</a>"
that I wrote, which is inspired by
"[sliding-door](https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/sliding-door)"
theme.  That gives me the bloglike nature, comments, search, and such.


Aside from customizing the theme, I took a lot of my old pages that were the
basis of my old site, converted them from HTML+JS to PHP+HTML and setup some hooks
for these pages to render using my static PHP files for the content of the
"page/post content" (the page content is "empty" in the wordpress DB for these
pages).  This allows me nicely to have a small set of static pages I mostly
manage and edit externally, but they still get the overall theme, comments,
tags, and such.
