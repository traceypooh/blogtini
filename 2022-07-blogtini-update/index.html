I'm now moving towards a setup that is entirely `markdown` and `js`.

I've got client-side searching woriking dynamically with `lunr`.

I'm setting up two `.git` hooks to run a small script before a `git commit` and after a `git merge`.

Then we should be pretty close to a fully automatically updated `sitemap.xml` and `staticman` setup for comments.
