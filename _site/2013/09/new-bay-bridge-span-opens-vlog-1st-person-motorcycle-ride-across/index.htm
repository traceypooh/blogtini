**Labor Day 2013, Monday night, ~10pm**
The Bay Bridge opens **7 hours before** the widely reported 5am tuesday reopening, after being completely closed for 5 full days.

My twin, Russ AKA "Green Magic Man" (google it 😉 (on green Ninja) and I are the first 30 vehicles on to the 8th street onramp and show you how the new Bay Bridge span looks like from a first person HD camera (courtesy of Hunter, thanks, Baby!)

Includes 2nd raw 30 minutes of entire trip in a 2nd file.
