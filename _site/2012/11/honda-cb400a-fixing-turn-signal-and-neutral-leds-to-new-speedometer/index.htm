Whups, my new speedo's turn indicator LED was only going on when left signal was running.

Thankfully, found [this post on hondatwins](http://www.hondatwins.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=140358#p140358) that mentioned the orange and light blue bike lines were actually active lines for when left or right turn signal was on -- not that they were positive and negative general lines. It also mentioned a (cheap/simple, yay!) fix to use two 3-amp diodes and tie them in together. A quick putt-putt to Radioshack and $2 later...

Success!

I focus mainly on that in this image, but also some other related notes.

I also have my new speedo's neutral LED light now turning on when bike is on (but not running) -- will see tomorrow if it **also** properly goes **off** when shift up when bike is running.
