I did it!<br/>
Take a SketchUp model into the new iOS ARKit. Using my SketchUp home remodel and Apple's ARKit (beta) for augmented reality.

### Goal

import a model (in this case, a remodel) to overlay onto existing real world that you can walk around and 'experience' and compare.

### Results

You can see the results in the youtube video as I step through the trickier setup parts and things that took the longest to sort out.
