I&#8217;m looking at starting up a new website to pick up where zx6e.net left off&#8230;I have a lot of the stickies and valuable information that I had saved over the years. I wanted to avoid a duplication of effort&#8230;hence why I&#8217;m asking whether this project ever got off the ground. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>Justin</p>\n",

That is pretty horrific/terrible, I&#8217;m a little stunned.   As an Archivist (major programmer at archive.org) this saddens me greatly.  You can still find some of our crawled versions of some of the pages here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zx6e.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://zx6e.net</a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really a shame &#8212; if they gave members some notice, we would have happily crawled it to the bottom and made sure it got saved in our archives fully&#8230;</p>\n",
