ouchie!
A steel cruiser bike roared blindly out of a blind drive and ran into me.  The impact "taco-ed" (crumpled) my wheel and pitched me over the handle bars and the 2nd bike. I hit the pavement, but managed to not break anything or hit my head.

I scraped up my fingers, tore up 4 fingernails, and scraped my elbow and knee. Later we'd learn it was all surface stuff and only my front wheel needed replacing.

**_Amazingly lucky to have had so little damage!_**

I was prolly doing 10-15 mph; other rider maybe 7-10.  All of this happened right in front of Hunter's horrified eyes!
