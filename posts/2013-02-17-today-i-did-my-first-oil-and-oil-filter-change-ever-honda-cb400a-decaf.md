Russ and I changed our motorcycle's oil and oil filters today.  This was the first time I've ever changed oil in a vehicle -- I guess it sort of was a life goal I figured I'd never get around to -- part of understanding cars/bikes more!   So it was a nice way to kick off the start of our 3-day holiday weekend.

The actual work on my bike was quite simple:

  * 1 ratchet-able bolt as the drain plug to release most of the used oil into oil drip pan
  * 1 ratchet-able bolt underneath to release the bike's oil pan and oil filter section

Russ helped figure out those bolts which I could confirm with a shop manual PDF.  Harder was sorting out what oil and filter to get/use and getting them.  I went with:

  * Valvoline SAE 10W-40 Motorcycle oil (for 4-strokes; non-synthetic; ideal for wet clutches) (AutoZone/Walmart)
  * K&N KN-111 oil filter (local motorcycle shop)

Putting everything back couldn't be easier -- slipped on new filter to bolt/cover, ratchet-ed the two bolts back in, and poured in ~3 quarts of oil.  I was happy parts were all in good shape and aside from some relatively dirty oil, no badness or surprises for my 35 year old bike.  Phew!
