I'm quite excited to have figured out so far how to:

  * update home machine to Sierra to run xCode 9 beta
  * start playing with xCode
  * borrow iPhone 7 with iOS 11 beta running on it
  * setup free provisioning for testing app
  * start with ARKit "hello world" type app demo from the amazing folks at Apple

ARKit possibilities are _blowing me away_!

_(That's the spaceship hoving in my office to left of my desk 😉_

Now!  On to hacking and trying out my app idea.... 😀 😀 😀
