Just watched Oliver Stone's [JFK](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102138/) for the first time last night.

I'd seen the recent
[Discovery Channel JFK programming](http://dsc.discovery.com/guides/history/unsolvedhistory/dealeyplaza/dealeyplaza.html)
that was excellent.

The **really** amazing thing was that when JFK movie came out, most of the media and Prez Ford (who was in the Warren Commission which did the post-assasination cover-up, er, I mean, investigation) denounced it. Now that more is declassified, most everything has shown to be true. _Multiple shooters!_

I'm progressive.

and i vote.

and i volunteer.

and i'm helping to take down the Bush Crime Family.
