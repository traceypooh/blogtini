So I wanted to sit down in my updated home theatre and watch one of my favorite films, "Star Wars". Problem is, I have two versions on DVD, and neither are ideal. The 2004 DVD version has remastered audio and video, but also added scenes and changes I really don't like. The 1977 DVD version is a poor quality transfer and encoding.

So I  **combined the 1977 and 2004 DVDs** into the highest quality 1977 version of the film! I show all my scripts and techniques here, too, so you can make the same version from your two DVDs, too!
