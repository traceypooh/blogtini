WE DID IT! We did our first AIDS charity bikeride and raised over $20,000 as part of the $11.6 million raised by the 2,500 riders plus 500 "roadies" for this weeklong event.

It was 7 days of biking (every day) to go from San Fran to LA in 545 miles (averaging 78 miles/day). We biked **every mile** and had a fantastic time.

I edited the [best 100 great photos](/photos/?ALC) from the week.
