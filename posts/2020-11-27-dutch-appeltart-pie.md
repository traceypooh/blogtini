# The Inspiration
This is a slight merge between my 🇮🇪 Grammy's Apple Pie recipe and the amazing 🇳🇱 Dutch Appeltart
you'll find all over the Netherlands.
I've had it from `Villa Zeezicht` in two visits 25 years apart - and their's is amazing!

This author's blog was captured by the WayBack Machine (where I work ;-)

and will be the main focus of this merged recipe.

[ dutch appeltart version ]


## For the dough
- 4 cups flour
- 1 ¼ cups sugar
- 1 tsp. salt
- 2 sticks + 2 Tbsps. cold butter, cut into small cubes
- 2 eggs
- 1 egg white, lightly beaten, for the glaze

## For the filling
- 3-4 pounds apples (8-10 medium apples); 1/2 Honeycrisp (sweet!); 1/2 Granny Smith (tart!)
- 1 Tbsp. cinnamon
- 1 Tbsp. nutmeg
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- entire small lemon

### Dough - In the bowl of a large (14-cup) food processor:
- combine the flour, sugar, and salt
- pulse to blend
- add the cubed butter, and process for about ten seconds, until the dough looks like a coarse meal
- add the two eggs, and pulse to incorporate
- split the dough into two lumps, each onto a sheet of plastic wrap, wrap tightly, and refrigerate for 1-2 hours

### Filling
While the dough is chilling (or, during the last half an hour of that time, anyway):
- butter and flour a 9-inch springform pan or pie form
- peel, core, and quarter the apples
- stir together the cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar in a small bowl
- combine mix with apples
- squeeze entire lemon over filling
- toss/mix
- preheat the oven to 350 degrees

### Bake!
- Press about 3/4 of the chilled dough into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan.
- The thickness of the dough along the sides should be about a quarter of an inch or, as the chef explained, the thickness of half of your index finger, sliced vertically, from knuckle to nail.
- Roll out the remaining dough for top crust (very thin is fine).
  - Use flour on roll and/or waxed paper as needed to keep together and peel off
- Add apple filling
- Add crust and pinch edges together
- Use knife and slice a heart or leaf in the center to vent
- Glaze with egg white
- Bake at 350 for 90 minutes to 2 hours (observe darkness of crust), rotating half-way through

### The Verdict
I wound up having some extra, so made a "cobbler" side dish.  I added some aluminum foil to cover it, with vents, for the first hour.  I also didn't glaze the pie top (it was getting late) and it wound up fine.

It was Amazing - best pie I've ever made!  😍

So similar to the Dutch Appeltart craving I've had since my twenties and my first trip to Amsterdam.  My twin and I were visiting my older brother who was spending a year in Amsterdam for his work.  We spent one of my favorite weeks in Europe ever, a lazy deliciously warm and sunny summer week, having cafes, beers, and pie outside his canal-overlooking 3-story apartment, meeting his friends, enjoying the scene and people, and walking around the city.  We topped that off with an amazing week visiting 🇫🇷 Paris and Versailles and Chateaux 🏰 all over the Loire Valley.
