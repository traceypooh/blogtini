After about 45 days of training for the big 7-day bikeride in June, [I got a new bike](/photos/?madone) to help me get through the long repetitive days in the saddle.

The training has been going well, and the last week with my first 100 miles with this new bike were even better!
I am a believer that a good carbon bike makes a world of difference.
Best of all, my bike is now on only about 1/4 pound heavier than Hunter's (so watch out, boyfriend!)
