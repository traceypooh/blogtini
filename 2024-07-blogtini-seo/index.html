We're now working on improved Search Engine Optimization by adding [head] element tags and
[JSON-LD](https://schema.org/BlogPosting)

Looking into a GitHub Actions step to create/update the `sitemap.xml` file as well as dynamically prepend a head with metadata and JSON-LD to the start of blog markdown `.html` files.

Also of interest is sharing markdown blog posts to social networks and pasting links into text messages.  We want the card-like preview with title and image relevant to the blog post to work.
